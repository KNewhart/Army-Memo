\beginEnumerateOne
\item\underline{INTRODUCTION.} Welcome to EV201, Introduction to Environmental Engineering. This course introduces Cadets to the environmental engineering profession to gain an appreciation for the interdisciplinary nature of the field. Fundamentals regarding engineering design are presented and a variety of tools are used to analyze and visualize solutions to environmental challenges. The course provides a platform for the incorporation of required skills students use throughout the rest of their engineering course of study. Cadets solve a series of progressively more complex engineering problems by applying the design process while addressing public health, safety, and welfare. The course introduces a variety of techniques to communicate effectively with a range of audiences as Cadets function effectively on teams and apply new knowledge and learning strategies.

\item\underline{COURSE OUTCOMES.}
	\beginEnumerateTwo
	\item Develop and analyze products and systems using the engineering design process
	\item Produce technical (drawings, reports) and non-technical (graphical) materials for universal communication of enginering design products and systems
	\item Understand the role of environmental engineers in the design process and the ethics of engineering design
	\end{enumerate}

\item\underline{COURSE OUTLINE.}

	\item TODO
	\end{enumerate}

\item\underline{TIME REQUIREMENTS.}
	\beginEnumerateTwo
	\item This course will be taught in 40 55-minute blocks. 
	\item On average, you will spend ~2 hours per lesson outside of class. 
	\end{enumerate}
	
\item\underline{COURSE MATERIAL.} 
	\beginEnumerateTwo
	\item TODO
	\item Lab notebook, choose one of the following options:
		\beginEnumerateThree
		\item \textit{Physical.} Sewn or glued bindings, NO spiral bound (e.g., composition, green notebook).
		\item \textit{Electronic.} Cannot allow changes (e.g., NO continuous MS Word documents). You may export pages to a PDF after each lab, and electronically sign/lock the file (\url{https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05895-3}).
		\end{enumerate}
		\item NCEES. \textit{FE Reference Handbook 10.1}. 2021.
	\end{enumerate}

\item\underline{COMMUNICATION.}  TODO

\item\underline{ABSENTEE POLICY.} Class attendance is both an academic responsibility and a military duty. If you have a planned absence, (e.g., trip section, quarters), submit your name, date, and reason to the instructor via email. You are fully responsible for any assignments due that day and the material presented. If you will miss a scheduled graded event, notify your instructor no later than two lessons prior to the absence.

\item\underline{GRADED EVENTS.} 

The following graded events will be used to measure learning in this class:

\begin{table}[h]

\caption{Summary of graded events and point allocations}
\label{tab:grades}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\hline
\textbf{Graded Event} & \textbf{Type}  & \textbf{Percent} & \textbf{Points} \\ \hline
Reading assignments	& 	Individual	& 	10		&  100	\\ \hline
Homeworks    		&	 Individual    & 	20         	& 200       \\ \hline
Lab reports    		& 	Group   	& 	20        	& 200    \\ \hline
Design report 		& 	Group 	& 10           		& 100          \\ \hline
WPRs      			& Individual         & 20           & 200                      \\ \hline
TEE         			& Individual           & 20           & 200                      \\ \hline
   				&   \textbf{Total}   & \textbf{100} & \textbf{1000} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}%
\end{table}

	\beginEnumerateTwo
	\item TODO
	\item Late work
		\beginEnumerateThree
		\item Assignments are due at the beginning of class on the lesson due date.
		\item If the assignment will be more than 24 hours late you must notify the instructor, or you will receive no credit.
		\item < 24 hours late = 10\% deduction
		\item 24 - 48 hours late = 20\% deduction
		\item >48 hours late = no credit, but MUST submit to pass course
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\item\underline{GRADING SCALE.}

The following D/G\&EnE grading scale will be applied to this class:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{EV401 grading scale}
\label{tab:lettergrades}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\hline
A+ & 100 - 97  & C+ & 79.9 - 77 \\ \hline
A  & 96.9 - 92 & C  & 76.9 - 72 \\ \hline
A- & 91.9 - 90 & C- & 71.9 - 70 \\ \hline
B+ & 89.9 - 87 & D  & 69.9 - 67 \\ \hline
B  & 86.9 - 82 & F  & 66.9 - 0  \\ \hline
B- & 81.9 - 80 &    &           \\ \hline
\end{tabular}%
\end{table}

\item\underline{DOCUMENTATION AND COLLABORATION.} You will adhere to the principles outlined in two guiding documents:

\beginEnumerateTwo
\item USMA Documentation of Academic Work (DAW)
	\beginEnumerateThree
	\item  Acknowledgment statement will be required with each homework submission. 
	\item Use the CSE name-year style for citations. 
	\item Your 'References' page will describe your source and the nature of help received.
	\end{enumerate}
\item D/G\&EnE Environmental Engineering Submission Standards
	\beginEnumerateThree
	\item Posted on Canvas
	\item Clean, professional work is expected. Points will be deducted for sloppy presentation or organization.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\item\underline{ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTION.} Use this link (\url{https://calendly.com/dr-newhart/ai}) to schedule a 30-minute block of time for AI. At least 24-hours notice is required to guarantee time. Drop-in's are allowed if my door is open.

\item\underline{CALCULATORS.} Calculators are the only computational device allowed during WPRs and the TEE. Programming additional functions into the calculator is not permitted.

\item\underline{ELECTRONIC DEVICES.} Laptop and tablet devices may be used during class for note taking and referencing material. You may not use these devices during class to check email/Teams, work on non-EV201 material, or browse the internet. 

\item\underline{CODE RED.} In the event of a Code Red, class will be held virtually. If a lab is scheduled for that day, the next lecture will be substituted and the lab rescheduled.
